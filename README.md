# Astrophotography guiding performance
This application reads the logs created by the ASIAIR device for PHD guiding and the Autorun log for image capture times.

The goal is to parse these logs and use them to create guiding performance graphs and possibly provide recommendations for which imaging frames should be dropped based on the guiding performance.

Work in progress!

Website running on https://astro-boys.nl

As an example, try uploading the Autolog and PHD guide files from the data directory in this repository.
